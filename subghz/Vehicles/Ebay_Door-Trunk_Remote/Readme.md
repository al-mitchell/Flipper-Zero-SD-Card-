Captures for a currently unknown ebay door/trunk remote that I FalsePhilosopher hope to create a backup to replace the backup remote my friend lost. It appears to be rolling somewhere from 433.80-434.20, using read with hopping on fm476 it picked up some faac slh 64 bit protocol signals. So here is a bunch of captures of the 3 buttons with the button pressed, held, and spammed. Also here is 3 raw reads of the 3 buttons in the same format of press, hold, spam. This is here as resources for the community to help build implementations for rolling code protocols for educational purposes. I will add pic's of the board and post chip data sheets if I can find them and try to get a product name an plot some subs when I can.
