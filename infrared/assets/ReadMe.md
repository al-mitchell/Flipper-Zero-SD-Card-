Keeping all the IR files in my fork of the [Flipper-IRDB](https://github.com/UberGuidoZ/Flipper-IRDB)! (I'm now able to maintain the entire branch.)

Did you know you can quickly generate your own IR files on the go at [Flipper Maker](https://flippermaker.github.io/)?

 Looking for an updated Universal Remote files? Then you're in the right place! [Unleashed](https://github.com/Eng1n33r/flipperzero-firmware) and [RogueMaster](https://github.com/RogueMaster/flipperzero-firmware-wPlugins) both include these.<br>
 ***Now with ALL buttons too!***  All files developed with support/testing from [UberGuidoZ](https://github.com/UberGuidoZ). HUGE thank you to [amec0e](https://github.com/amec0e) for maintenance!

[Unleashed firmware](https://github.com/Eng1n33r/flipperzero-firmware/releases/latest) was the first to add all of the Universal Remotes. Highly advise checking out their work. (Thanks [xMasterx](https://github.com/xMasterx)!)

Huge thank you to [ChaoticDynamic aka c-nagy](https://github.com/c-nagy) for some duplicate signal and file cleanup ([details here](https://github.com/UberGuidoZ/Flipper/pull/16).)<br>

**You may have manifest file issues if you do not compile your own firmware, or use one of the listed firmwares above!**<br>
*Both unlocked firmwares have been tested successfully. Official has stated they will merge it at some point.*

**NOTE: Long pauses are normal, including 10-15 seconds of no apparent activity. It's just skipping through the "other" buttons.**

Click on the file of your choice and save it with a right-click from the `Raw` button here:

Then, use qFlipper to transfer it to your Flipper and replace the existing one (or add a new one) here:

***Again, you may have manifest file issues if you do not compile your own or use a tested firmware above!***
