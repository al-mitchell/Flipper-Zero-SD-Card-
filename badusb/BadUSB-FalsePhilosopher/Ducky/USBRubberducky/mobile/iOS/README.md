# iOS-Payloads | O.MG and Hak5
This repository is a collection of all my Hak5 ducky script payloads written for iOS with a focus on iPhone

Please note that all these payloads come in a disarmed state with timing and certain varibales being filled with a placeholder, this is to prevent any misuse with these payloads, I write all these payloads for security research and with intent to be used for informing and showcasing the O.MG cable 

---PLEASE NOTE---

These payloads require a OTG adapter to be plugged into the device with the O.MG cables active end plugged into the adapter, OTG adapters allow iphones to act as a host and allow input to make these payloads work, 

These payloads were written on on iOS 16.1 - iOS 16.2 timing and actions might be diffrent for different versions of iOS
