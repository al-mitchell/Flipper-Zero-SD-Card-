### 1 - Introduction:


**What is CDN :**

A **Content Delivery Network** is refers to a group of servers geographically placed so that content can be distributed quickly over internet.
CDNs can deliver content quickly while reducing bandwidth, increasing content availability and redundancy or even increasing site security and optimization.


**What is SNI & ESNI :**

The **Server Name Indication (SNI) protocol** is an extension to the **TLS** protocol and allows the client to indicate **the hostname** with which it is trying to start a TLS handshake. 
This allows the server to present multiple certificates for the same IP address but different hostnames, and thus to share hosting for secure https sites.
