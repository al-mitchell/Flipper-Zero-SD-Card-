# FlipperAmiibo
Made to be used with Flipper just unzip & drag the folder (Amiibo Database 2018 - 2022) into NFC folder

Best way to select through Amiibo's is using Flipper Browser (Down arrow press then goto NFC clicking right arrow)

Developer's build should fix any issues with certain Amiibo's that were not working properly because of read & write amiibos needed to function on flipper

You will need a program to read .zip file like 7-Zip OR WinRAR to unzip the folder

# Highly Recommend to transfer Folder on SD connected directly to PC 
SD Card/nfc/

However you can use qFlipper but it's very slow!!
Open qFlipper and connect your flipper.
*Please note that your flipper should already be updated to the latest version. I'm on version 0.58.1-Unleashed

In the file system you are going to copy the Amiibo database into your NFC folder. You can right click and choose “upload here…” or drag and drop it into the window. 

# Thanks @StormCrow for the instructions Guide on using FlipperAmiibo with photos! (Included under this text)

# Don’t try to access the NFC by clicking the select (center button) on the flipper directional pad.

# It will result in the flipper not displaying the Database Folder seen here:

# You will need to access it by clicking on the down arrow in the directional pad to enter the Archive window and either going to the Browser tab or going to the NFC tab.

# Once you are in the NFC tab you should see your Amiibo Database.

# From there you should be able to navigate to any Amiibo and emulate it correctly.

# The bug still remains that you can’t see the database by going through the select button on the directional pad to NFC, but you can still get to it through the Browser or using the arrow keys to get to the NFC folder.
